Caesar Cipher in Python
This project is a simple implementation of the Caesar Cipher algorithm using Python. The Caesar Cipher is one of the oldest and most basic encryption techniques. It works by shifting the letters of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions, making it a classic example of a substitution cipher.

üîê Features
Encrypt plaintext using a specified shift key

Decrypt ciphertext using the same shift key

Supports both uppercase and lowercase letters

Ignores non-alphabetic characters during encryption/decryption

Simple command-line interface for quick use and testing

üìú How It Works
The Caesar Cipher shifts each letter in the input text by a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. For example, with a shift of 3:

A becomes D

B becomes E

...

Z becomes C

To decrypt, the shift is reversed.
